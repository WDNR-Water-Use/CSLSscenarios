# CSLSscenarios

CSLSscenarios is an R package containing code and results generated by the
Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources for the lake ecosystem response
analysis of the Central Sands Lakes Study (CSLS).

Key datasets contain calculated hydrologic metrics for each simulation of each
38-year scenario (`data/MODFLOW_metrics`) and a comparison to
no-irrigated-agriculture metrics (`data/MODFLOW_comparison`), with significant
thresholds and impact (T/F) determinations. These datasets are generated by
`data-raw/calculate_MODFLOW_metrics.R` and `data-raw/compare_MODFLOW_scenarios`.
Rerunning requires the MODFLOW results contained in `CSLSdata` and may take a
while - generally 30 min++ on my machine to run for all scenarios and
simulations.

The full suite of hydrologic metrics is calculated for each simualtion via
`R/calculate_metrics.R`. The ecological rules underpinning the significant
impact assessment are collated in `data/ecological_rules` and interpreted by the
`R/compare_scenarios.R`.

Details on data and code can also be found in `inst/CSLSscenarios_1.0.0.pdf`.

## Installation

Several data files in this package are hosted via Git Large File Storage (LFS).
You may need to install LFS in order for some files to download properly via
git.

To install or explore this R package, you may:

  1. Use devtools to install the package. This will allow you to load the 
  cleaned Rda data files and explore vignettes.  
  ```
  devtools::install_github("WDNR-Water-Use/CSLSdata", build_vignettes=T)
  ```
  
  2. Fork from github, clone or download ZIP, then open the cslsdata.prj file in 
  R. This will allow you to also explore the raw data files and cleaning scripts
  included in `data-raw/`.

  3. You may instead be interested in the csv equivalents of Rda data files,
  which are saved under `inst/csv/`. These are updated every time the Rda data
  files are, and may be more accessible for non-R users or those more
  comfortable in other programming languages.
